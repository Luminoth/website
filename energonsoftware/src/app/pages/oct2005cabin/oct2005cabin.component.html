    I spent the days of October 13th through October 17th, 2005 at my grandparent's cabin. While there, I took some
    sweet pictures. Sadly, I forgot to get pictures of the entire day of the 14th. My cousin-in-law and I took my dog,
    Yuki, on a hike and went with my uncle on their trip to hunt deer. They had put in for doe tags and both ended up
    getting it. No one got any big kills, but we saw lots of elk poop and grouse. I didn't get any pictures of any of
    that though. Here's what I did manage to get instead:
  </div>
  <div class="fx-flex-15px"></div>
  @if (hasPictures) {
  <ngb-carousel>
    @for (picture of pictures; track picture) {
    <ng-template ngbSlide>
      @for (image of picture.images; track image) {
      <div class="picsum-img-wrapper">
        <img [src]="getImageUrl(image)">
      </div>
      }
      <div class="carousel-caption">
        {{picture.text}}
      </div>
    </ng-template>
    }
  </ngb-carousel>
  }
</div>
