# TODO
1. Get rid of tables wherever they exist!
  * Replace with Material Design grids
  1. WoW addons
2. Need to mobile-friendly test all the pages
3. Check RSS links
4. Finish converting WoW data from .ini to .json
5. Rebuild resume page using a JSON backend
6. Pull download info from the database
7. Rebuild links page with a JSON backend
8. Probably could re-organize the partials/views to be more consistent with ASP.NET organization
9. Carousel dot things are not following the active slide set correctly
10. Unicode pagination should be centered on the page
11. Replace more Bootstrap code with Angular Material Design

Keep an eye on this bug: https://github.com/angular-ui/bootstrap/issues/3811 it appears to be the reason that the carousel's have stopped working
(Angular UI supports Angular 1.3, but not Angular 1.4)
